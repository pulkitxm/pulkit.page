## Why String and Number Aren’t Enough

When your project is small, you can get away with using plain `string` and `number` for everything. But as your codebase grows, multiple entities, multiple IDs, different units of measure, **“just use `string`” turns into a source of subtle, expensive bugs**.

In this post, you’ll see:

- **Why plain primitives break down** in real-world codebases
- **How branded types work in TypeScript** (with a single reusable `Brand` helper)
- **How to push brands into Drizzle ORM and Zod**, so your types stay consistent end‑to‑end
- **How to handle raw values, numbers, and units** with brands
- **When to use brands vs unions, template literals, or wrappers**

---

## The Core Problem: All Strings Look the Same

In most TypeScript codebases, IDs and primitive values are just strings or numbers:

```typescript
type UserId = string;
type InvoiceId = string;
type SaleId = string;
```

This works until your app grows. Then you see code like:

```typescript
function getInvoice(id: InvoiceId) {
  return { id };
}

async function example() {
  const user = await getUser();
  getInvoice(user.latestSaleId);
}
```

If `latestSaleId` is a `string` and `getInvoice` expects a `string`, **TypeScript is perfectly happy**. But conceptually, this is wrong:

- `latestSaleId` is a `SaleId`
- `getInvoice` wants an `InvoiceId`

Both are strings, but they are **different concepts**. In a large codebase with dozens of ID types (user, org, tenant, order, invoice, payment, session…), this kind of mix-up becomes easy and dangerous.

You want the **type system to encode your domain**, not just primitive shapes.

---

## Your First Branded Type

A **branded type** lets you create a distinct type from a primitive, without changing its runtime representation.

Let’s start with a single branded `InvoiceId`:

```typescript
declare const __brand: unique symbol;

export type InvoiceId = string & { [__brand]: "invoiceId" };
```

Here:

- `InvoiceId` is still a `string` at runtime.
- The extra `{ [__brand]: "invoiceId" }` part only exists in the type system.
- Because `__brand` is a `unique symbol`, TypeScript treats `InvoiceId` as different from plain `string`.

You can now write:

```typescript
function getInvoice(id: InvoiceId) {
  return { id };
}

declare const invoiceId: InvoiceId;
declare const rawString: string;

getInvoice(invoiceId); // ✅

getInvoice(rawString); // ❌ Type error
```

You still pass strings at runtime, but the compiler prevents you from accidentally passing any old `string` that isn’t an `InvoiceId`.

---

### Creating an InvoiceId Value

Most of the time you will start from a plain string (for example from your database or an external API) and want to treat it as an `InvoiceId`:

```typescript
const rawId = "inv_123";

const invoiceId: InvoiceId = rawId as InvoiceId;
```

This does not change anything at runtime; it only tells TypeScript that this particular value should be considered an `InvoiceId`. Later in the post we will see safer ways to do this branding (with Zod and assertion functions), but this is the minimal starting point.

### Drizzle: Getting Branded IDs from the Database

You can also push the brand into your database schema so that Drizzle returns an `InvoiceId` automatically:

```typescript
import { pgTable, varchar } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

declare const __brand: unique symbol;

export type InvoiceId = string & { [__brand]: "invoiceId" };

export const invoices = pgTable("invoices", {
  id: varchar("id").$type<InvoiceId>().primaryKey(),
});

async function loadInvoice() {
  const invoice = await db.query.invoices.findFirst();
  if (!invoice) {
    return;
  }

  invoice.id; // InvoiceId
  getInvoice(invoice.id);
}
```

Now the schema is the single source of truth for the brand: everywhere else in your app, `invoice.id` is already typed as `InvoiceId`, and `getInvoice` can rely on that.

---

## Branded Types in One Reusable Helper

Copy‑pasting the `__brand` pattern for every type gets noisy quickly, so we can generalize it into a reusable helper:

```typescript
declare const brand: unique symbol;

type Brand<T, B extends string> = T & { readonly [brand]: B };

type UserId = Brand<string, "UserId">;
type InvoiceId = Brand<string, "InvoiceId">;
type SaleId = Brand<string, "SaleId">;
```

We’ll use this `Brand<T, B>` helper throughout the rest of the post:

- `Brand<T, B>` takes a base type `T` (like `string` or `number`) and intersects it with a phantom property keyed by a unique `symbol`.
- `declare const brand: unique symbol` exists only in the type system. No property is emitted at runtime.
- Each distinct brand string (`"UserId"`, `"InvoiceId"`, `"SaleId"`) produces a **distinct, non‑interchangeable type**, even though all are still just strings at runtime.

Now TypeScript can tell all these concepts apart while your runtime values stay simple.

---

## Using Branded Types in Your APIs

Once you have branded types, you can make your APIs much clearer:

```typescript
type UserId = Brand<string, "UserId">;
type InvoiceId = Brand<string, "InvoiceId">;

function getInvoice(id: InvoiceId) {
  return { id };
}

function getUserInvoices(userId: UserId) {
  return [];
}

declare const userId: UserId;
declare const invoiceId: InvoiceId;

getInvoice(invoiceId); // ✅
// getInvoice(userId)      // ❌ Type error

getUserInvoices(userId); // ✅
// getUserInvoices(invoiceId) // ❌ Type error
```

The more your domain grows, the more these branded types protect you from wiring things up incorrectly.

## Validating and Branding Input (Type Guards & Assertions)

The tricky part is turning **untyped input** (e.g. from `req.params` or query strings) into branded values.

### Type guards

Use a type guard to check a value and narrow it to a brand:

```typescript
type InvoiceId = Brand<string, "InvoiceId">;

function isInvoiceId(value: string): value is InvoiceId {
  return value.startsWith("inv_"); // basically validating if the string is like inv_123
}

function handleRequest(idParam: string) {
  if (!isInvoiceId(idParam)) {
    throw new Error("Invalid invoice ID");
  }

  const invoiceId = idParam;
  getInvoice(invoiceId); // invoiceId: InvoiceId
}
```

Inside the `if`, TypeScript knows `invoiceId` is an `InvoiceId`.

### Assertion functions

For cleaner call sites, you can wrap that check in an assertion:

```typescript
type PositiveSeconds = Brand<number, "PositiveSeconds">;

function isPositiveSeconds(value: number): value is PositiveSeconds {
  return value > 0;
}

function assertPositiveSeconds(
  value: number,
): asserts value is PositiveSeconds {
  if (!isPositiveSeconds(value)) {
    throw new Error("Expected a positive number of seconds");
  }
}

function waitForSeconds(seconds: PositiveSeconds) {
  return new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(resolve, seconds * 1000);
  });
}

function scheduleReminder(seconds: number) {
  assertPositiveSeconds(seconds);
  return waitForSeconds(seconds);
}
```

At the boundary (e.g. controller, API handler), you validate once. After `assertPositiveSeconds`, the compiler treats `seconds` as a `PositiveSeconds` everywhere downstream.

<details>

<summary><strong>Wait, what do <code>asserts</code> and <code>is</code> mean here?</strong></summary>

If you’re confused by the `is` and `asserts` keywords in these function signatures, here’s what they do:

- `value is PositiveSeconds` in\
  `function isPositiveSeconds(value: number): value is PositiveSeconds`\
  is a **type predicate**. The function still returns a `boolean` at runtime, but at the type level it tells TypeScript:\
  “When this function returns `true`, you can treat `value` as `PositiveSeconds` inside the `if` block.”

- `asserts value is PositiveSeconds` in\
  `function assertPositiveSeconds(value: number): asserts value is PositiveSeconds`\
  makes this an **assertion function**. It doesn’t return a value; instead:
  - If it throws, execution stops.
  - If it returns without throwing, TypeScript assumes `value` is now definitely `PositiveSeconds` for all code that comes after the call.

So:

```typescript
if (isPositiveSeconds(seconds)) {
  // inside this block, seconds is PositiveSeconds
}

assertPositiveSeconds(seconds);
// after this line, seconds is PositiveSeconds everywhere below
```

Type predicates (`value is T`) narrow types inside conditionals, while assertion functions (`asserts value is T`) narrow types for all subsequent code if they return.

</details>

### Branding trusted values

Sometimes you generate values yourself and already know they’re valid. In those cases, a tiny helper is enough:

```typescript
type InvoiceId = Brand<string, "InvoiceId">;

function asInvoiceId(value: string): InvoiceId {
  return value as InvoiceId;
}

const id = asInvoiceId(`inv_${crypto.randomUUID()}`);
```

This does not validate; it just tells TypeScript, “this value is already safe”.

---

## Using Branded Types with Zod

Zod is your first line of defense for untrusted input (HTTP requests, forms, webhooks). You want it to emit values that are already branded.

### Why not use `z.string().brand()` directly?

Zod has a `.brand()` helper:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const InvoiceIdSchema = z.string().uuid().brand("InvoiceId");

type ZodInvoiceId = z.infer<typeof InvoiceIdSchema>;
```

This works, but `ZodInvoiceId` is a **Zod-specific brand**, not your shared `InvoiceId` type. You’d end up with multiple “brands” for the same concept across your app.

### Use `.transform()` to apply your own brand

A better approach is to validate with Zod, then apply your `Brand`:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

type InvoiceId = Brand<string, "InvoiceId">;

const InvoiceIdSchema = z
  .string()
  .uuid()
  .transform((value) => value as InvoiceId);

type InvoiceIdFromZod = z.infer<typeof InvoiceIdSchema>; // InvoiceId
```

Usage:

```typescript
const result = InvoiceIdSchema.safeParse(input);

if (!result.success) {
  throw new Error("Invalid invoice ID");
}

const invoiceId = result.data; // InvoiceId

getInvoice(invoiceId);
```

Now:

- Zod emits `InvoiceId`
- Drizzle returns `InvoiceId`
- Your helpers accept and return `InvoiceId`

**One brand, shared across your whole stack.**

## Branding More Than Just IDs (Units, Currency, Content)

Branded types are not just for IDs. They work with any primitive or structural type.

### Units and time

```typescript
type Milliseconds = Brand<number, "Milliseconds">;
type Seconds = Brand<number, "Seconds">;

function sleep(seconds: Seconds) {
  return new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(resolve, seconds * 1000);
  });
}

declare const delayMs: Milliseconds;
declare const delaySec: Seconds;

sleep(delaySec); // ✅
// sleep(delayMs) // ❌ Type error
```

No more accidentally mixing `ms` and `s`.

### Currency and other numeric domains

```typescript
type InrRupee = Brand<number, "InrRupee">;
type UsdCents = Brand<number, "UsdCents">;

interface Invoice {
  total: InrRupee;
}

declare const inr: InrRupee;
declare const usd: UsdCents;

const invoice: Invoice = { total: inr }; // ✅
// const bad: Invoice = { total: usd }  // ❌ Type error
```

You can add more domain rules (e.g. non‑negative) with the assertion patterns shown earlier.

### Safe vs unsafe content

```typescript
type SafeHtml = Brand<string, "SafeHtml">;

declare function sanitize(input: string): SafeHtml;

function render(html: SafeHtml) {
  document.body.innerHTML = html;
}

const userInput = `<script>alert('xss')</script>`;

render(sanitize(userInput)); // ✅
// render(userInput)        // ❌ Type error
```

The brand forces all HTML to go through your sanitizer before it ever touches `innerHTML`.

---

## When Branded Types Are Not the Best Tool

Branded types are great, but they are not always the simplest or clearest choice.

### Use unions for small closed sets

If a value can only be one of a few literals, a union is usually clearer:

```typescript
type TaskStatus = "pending" | "rejected" | "resolved";

interface Task {
  status: TaskStatus;
}
```

You get exhaustiveness checking in `switch` statements with no branding overhead.

### Use template literal types for patterns

When valid strings follow a pattern, template literal types can encode that pattern directly:

```typescript
type ThemeBase = "dark" | "light" | "system";
type ThemeContrast = "high" | "low" | "standard";

type Theme = `${ThemeBase}-${ThemeContrast}`;

function setTheme(theme: Theme) {
  return theme;
}

setTheme("dark-high"); // ✅
// setTheme("dark-regular") // ❌ Type error
```

No brands needed, the pattern is in the type itself.

### Use wrappers for strongest runtime guarantees

If you need heavyweight safety (e.g. security‑critical code), a wrapper type can enforce invariants at creation:

```typescript
interface Positive {
  value: number;
}

function createPositive(value: number): Positive {
  if (value <= 0) {
    throw new Error("Expected a positive number");
  }

  return { value };
}
```

This adds runtime cost and a new object, but the guarantee is very strong.

## Community Helpers: `ts-brand` and `effect`

If you don’t want to maintain your own `Brand` helper, two solid libraries exist:

- **[`ts-brand`](https://github.com/kourge/ts-brand)**: a tiny, focused branded-type utility.
- **[`effect`](https://effect.website)**: a full framework that includes a powerful `Brand` module with helpers like `Brand.refined`.

Example with `ts-brand`:

```typescript
import { Brand } from "ts-brand";

type UserId = Brand<string, "UserId">;

function getUser(id: UserId) {
  return id;
}
```

Example with `effect`:

```typescript
import { Brand } from "effect";

type Positive = number & Brand.Brand<"Positive">;

const asPositive = Brand.refined<Positive>(
  (value) => value > 0,
  (value) => Brand.error(`Non-positive value: ${value}`),
);
```

Both use the same phantom‑property trick you saw earlier, just packaged and maintained for you.

---

## When Branded Types Shine

Branded types are most valuable when:

- You have **many concepts that share the same primitive** (multiple IDs, currencies, units, etc.)
- You work in a **medium or large codebase** with many contributors
- You want to **encode domain rules into the type system** instead of relying on comments and discipline

They are less critical when:

- Your project is small and simple
- There are only one or two ID types
- You rarely pass raw strings or numbers around

For most serious TypeScript backends or larger frontends, the safety and clarity benefits often outweigh the small amount of extra type complexity.

---

## Bringing It All Together

With a small amount of setup, you can get an end‑to‑end safety net:

- **Branded types in TypeScript** to distinguish concepts like `UserId`, `InvoiceId`, `SaleId`, `Seconds`, `Milliseconds`
- **Drizzle ORM with `$type<Brand<...>>()`** so your database results carry the right brands automatically
- **Zod with `.transform()`** so validated input is branded consistently
- **Type guards and assertion functions** to convert untrusted primitives at the boundaries

Over time, this dramatically reduces accidental mix‑ups, clarifies your APIs, and pushes domain rules into the type system where the compiler can enforce them.
