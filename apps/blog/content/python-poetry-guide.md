Managing Python dependencies can be hard, especially as projects get bigger. It's important to have the right packages and versions installed without conflicts. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) helps with this. It's a tool that makes managing project dependencies, packaging, and publishing easier. In this article, we'll show you how to use Poetry to manage Python dependencies, make your workflow smoother, and keep your project setup clean and efficient.

In this blog, you will learn how to:

- Install Poetry on your system
- Create a new Poetry project
- How to run fastapi server with poetry

## Installing Poetry

Reference: [python-poetry.org/docs/#installation](http://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

```plaintext
curl -ssl https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

## Create a new Poetry Project

```plaintext
poetry new awesome-project
```

This will create a fresh poetry project with a directory structure like this

### Pyproject.toml

Poetry manages all the dependencies with the help of the `pyproject.toml`, It is similar to the `package.json` in a node project

```plaintext
[tool.poetry]
name = "awesome-project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = ""
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
readme = "README.md"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.12"


[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

### Activate a virtual environment

You can list all the [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) available in poetry

```plaintext
poetry shell
```

## Let's make a simple hello world FastAPI Server

### Adding fastapi and uvicorn as dependencies

```plaintext
poetry add fastapi uvicorn
```

![Terminal showing FastAPI and Uvicorn installation with Poetry](/assets/content/blogs/simplifying-python-dependency-management-with-poetry/ec031e29-236e-4e62-8795-9fb7c0e0ee6b.webp)

Now if you check the pyproject.toml, fastapi and uvicorn are added as dependencies

![pyproject.toml file showing added dependencies](/assets/content/blogs/simplifying-python-dependency-management-with-poetry/fdfbc518-fe35-464e-9829-089b274f21d6.webp)

Write a basic fastapi server

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, World!"}
```

![FastAPI server code in editor](/assets/content/blogs/simplifying-python-dependency-management-with-poetry/8ea0f089-8cb2-4137-9159-cfe657b51cbd.webp)

To run the server lets start by using the following command

```plaintext
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

And as expected the server is in a good condition
