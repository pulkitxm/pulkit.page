### The Idea

Creating a visually appealing and functional portfolio website is essential for showcasing your skills and projects. I recently explored website designs from popular examples for my portfolio ([pulkitxm.com](https://pulkitxm.com)) and found one animation that really excites me: the horizontal scroll percentage indicator. It is useful for tracking how much of the webpage you have scrolled.

### The concept

![Horizontal scroll indicator at top of webpage](/assets/content/blogs/creating-a-dynamic-horizontal-scroll-percentage-indicator-with-react-and-framer-motion/a1036438-6dac-4c32-bcf3-78d877cd2de8.webp)

As you can see here, it basically sits at the top of the webpage, and yes, it is as minimalist as it looks.

### The Implementation

In this article, we'll implement this using React and Framer Motion.

I have my react project bootstrapped, starting by installing

![Terminal showing framer-motion installation](/assets/content/blogs/creating-a-dynamic-horizontal-scroll-percentage-indicator-with-react-and-framer-motion/ba462a68-961b-4df5-b230-3011f8297166.webp)

```bash
pnpm add framer-motion
```

To get a good viewport to observe the scroll effect, I am adding a test height.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <div
        style={{
          height: "300vh",
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

Now let's add the main div that's gonna act like the scroll indicator

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <motion.div
        style={{
          position: "fixed",
          top: 0,
          left: 0,
          width: "20vw",
          height: "10px",
          backgroundColor: "black",
          borderRadius: "0 10px 10px 0",
        }}
      />
      <div
        style={{
          height: "300vh",
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

You can read more about [**The \<motion /> component**](https://www.framer.com/motion/introduction/#:~:text=%23-,The%20%3Cmotion%20/%3E%20component,-The%20core%20of), but in a nutshell, it is a component from Framer Motion that allows you to animate elements in a simple and declarative way.

And the styles are simple. The element is fixed at the top left of the screen, with a width of 0 (the main property that will act like a slider) and a height of 10 pixels. It has a black background and rounded corners on the right side.

Now let's animate it to move when we scroll. We'll use the `useScroll()` hook from framer-motion.

```jsx
import { useScroll } from "framer-motion";

const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll();
```

Now, to animate the changing values received from `scrollYProgress`, we will use the `useTransform` hook from framer-motion.

```jsx
const width = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 1], ["0%", "100%"]);
```

Here, the width will provide an animated value based on `scrollYProgress`. As you scroll from the top to the bottom of the page, the width changes from "0%" to "100%". This is done by mapping the `scrollYProgress` values (which range from 0 to 1) to the corresponding width values.

```jsx
import { motion, useScroll, useTransform } from "framer-motion";

export default function App() {
  const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll();
  const width = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 1], ["0%", "102%"]);
  return (
    <main>
      <motion.div
        style={{
          position: "fixed",
          top: 0,
          left: 0,
          height: "10px",
          backgroundColor: "black",
          borderRadius: "0 10px 10px 0",
          width,
        }}
      />
      <div
        style={{
          height: "300vh",
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

So, we use the width as a style prop for the `motion.div`. And that's pretty much it for animating the scroll indicator.
