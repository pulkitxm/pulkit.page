Remember the Vercel conference badge? The 3D lanyard that swung when you dragged it, responding to your movements with satisfying weight and momentum? That wasn't just a cool demo. It was physics-based animation at its finest, rigid body simulation with damping, gravity, and joint constraints creating motion that feels genuinely real.

Based on [Vercel's interactive 3D event
badge](https://vercel.com/blog/building-an-interactive-3d-event-badge-with-react-three-fiber)

The badge doesn't follow your cursor directly. It lags behind, overshoots, and settles. That's physics, damping controls the resistance, gravity pulls it down, and joint constraints keep it connected. No one specified "animate for 400ms." The motion emerges from the physical properties themselves.

This is the core insight behind spring animations. While the badge demo uses full rigid-body physics simulation, spring animations capture the same essence in a simpler form: motion defined by physical properties rather than arbitrary durations.

## The Problem with Duration

When you define an animation with `300ms ease-out`, you're telling the browser exactly how long something should take to move. But nothing in the real world moves that way. A ball doesn't decide "I'll take 300 milliseconds to stop bouncing." It bounces until the physics say it's done.

Watch someone slide a book across a table. They don't think about timing. They push with a certain force, and the book slides until friction stops it. The duration is a consequence of the physics, not a parameter you set.

CSS animations work backwards. You decide the duration first, then try to make the easing feel natural. But this creates a fundamental disconnect: you're forcing time onto motion instead of letting motion determine time.

Spring animations flip this around. They're defined by physical properties, how stiff is the spring, how much resistance is there, how heavy is the object. The duration emerges naturally from these properties, just like that conference badge swinging until it settles.

## TL;DR

- **Springs don't have fixed durations.** They animate until the physics settle, making motion feel more organic
- **Three core properties.** Stiffness (snappiness), damping (resistance), mass (weight/inertia)
- **Interruptibility is the killer feature.** Springs preserve velocity when re-targeted, CSS can't
- **Use bounce sparingly.** Only where physical interaction justifies it (drag gestures, not button clicks)
- **Perceptual duration.** Apple's approach lets you think in time while getting spring physics
- **Trade-offs exist.** Springs require JS libraries, add bundle size, aren't always necessary

## Seeing the Difference

[Interactive example: Spring Vs Easing](https://www.pulkit.blog/series/design-engineering/the-physics-behind-natural-motion)

The bottom ball uses spring physics. Notice how it overshoots slightly and settles into position. The top ball moves with a fixed duration ease-out. Both technically "work," but one feels alive and the other feels calculated.

This distinction matters more than you might think. iOS uses spring animations everywhere. It's why swiping between apps feels fluid. It's why the Dynamic Island morphs like a living thing. Apple didn't choose springs because they're fancy. They chose them because human perception is incredibly sensitive to motion that doesn't match physical expectations.

## The Physics of Springs

A spring animation simulates an object attached to a spring. Three properties control its behavior:

**Stiffness** is how "tight" the spring is. Higher stiffness means the object snaps to its target faster. Think of the difference between a rubber band and a bungee cord.

**Damping** is how much resistance the spring encounters. Higher damping means less oscillation. Zero damping would bounce forever. Very high damping acts like moving through honey.

**Mass** is how heavy the object is. Heavier objects take longer to accelerate and decelerate. They have more inertia.

[Interactive example: Spring Config Playground](https://www.pulkit.blog/series/design-engineering/the-physics-behind-natural-motion)

These properties are unintuitive at first. There's no actual mass or spring in your interface. But the mental model helps: if you want something to feel heavy and deliberate, increase mass. If you want something snappy and responsive, increase stiffness. If you want less bounce, increase damping.

### The Math

Spring animations solve a differential equation that models a damped harmonic oscillator. You don't need to know the math, but understanding what's happening helps:

```text
F = -kx - cv + ma

k = stiffness (spring force)
c = damping coefficient
m = mass
x = displacement from target
v = velocity
a = acceleration
```

Each frame, the animation calculates the forces acting on the object and updates its position and velocity. This continues until the object is close enough to the target and moving slowly enough to be considered "at rest."

The beauty is that this produces natural motion without you having to design the curve. The curve emerges from the physics.

## Interruptibility

Here's where springs genuinely outperform CSS animations. What happens when an animation is interrupted?

With CSS, if you change an element's target position mid-animation, the element jumps to its current position and starts a new animation from there. The velocity is lost. The motion feels discontinuous.

With springs, the animation preserves velocity when re-targeted. If the object was moving right and you change its target to the left, it doesn't stop and restart. It curves naturally toward the new target, using its existing momentum.

[Interactive example: Interruptibility](https://www.pulkit.blog/series/design-engineering/the-physics-behind-natural-motion)

Click around rapidly. Notice how the ball curves toward each new position, never losing its momentum. This is impossible with CSS transitions. It's why libraries like Framer Motion exist.

This matters for any UI where users can interact faster than your animations complete. Toasts appearing while previous ones are still animating. Tabs switching rapidly. Drag-and-drop where targets change mid-drag. Springs handle all of this gracefully because they're not locked into a duration.

### The Sonner Problem

[Emil Kowalski](https://x.com/emilkowalski), who created [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski)(the toast library), made an interesting choice. He used CSS animations for enter transitions. The problem? If you trigger two toasts quickly, the first toast jumps to its new position because CSS animations can't be interrupted smoothly.

[Interactive example: Toast Interrupt](https://www.pulkit.blog/series/design-engineering/the-physics-behind-natural-motion)

This is a trade-off. Sonner prioritizes bundle size over perfectly smooth interruptions. For most use cases, it's fine. But it illustrates why spring animations matter: they handle the edge cases that CSS can't.

## The Bounce Question

Spring animations can bounce. But should they?

In most product UI, no. Bounce draws attention. It says "look at me!" That's appropriate for:

- **Drag-to-dismiss gestures.** The user applied force, so a bounce at the end feels physical
- **Playful interactions.** Games, creative tools, marketing sites
- **Error states.** A shake with slight bounce communicates "nope"

It's inappropriate for:

- **Navigation.** Pages sliding in shouldn't bounce
- **Modals.** Opening a dialog shouldn't feel playful
- **Data displays.** Tables updating shouldn't call attention to themselves
- **Professional apps.** Banking, medical, enterprise software

[Interactive example: Bounce Comparison](https://www.pulkit.blog/series/design-engineering/the-physics-behind-natural-motion)

The rule I follow: if the user physically interacted (drag, swipe, throw), bounce can make sense. If the system initiated the motion (show modal, display toast, load content), keep it smooth.

When you do use bounce, keep it subtle. Apple's guidance from their engineering team:

| Bounce Value | Feel              | Use Case                              |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **0**        | Smooth, gradual   | General purpose, default choice       |
| **\~0.15**   | Brisk, subtle     | Snappy without obvious bounce         |
| **\~0.3**    | Noticeable bounce | Playful interactions                  |
| **> 0.4**    | Exaggerated       | Use with caution, may feel cartoonish |

The recommendation is clear: when in doubt, use `bounce: 0`. It gives you a versatile spring that works everywhere. Only add bounce when the interaction genuinely calls for it.

```typescript
const SPRING_CONFIGS = {
  smooth: { stiffness: 300, damping: 30, mass: 1 },
  responsive: { stiffness: 400, damping: 25, mass: 0.8 },
  bouncy: { stiffness: 300, damping: 10, mass: 1 },
  gentle: { stiffness: 150, damping: 20, mass: 1 },
};
```

## Duration, Reimagined

If springs don't have duration, how do you control timing?

Apple solved this elegantly. Instead of stiffness and damping, you can define springs with **duration** and **bounce**. But here's the key insight: there are actually two different "durations" at play.

**Settling duration** is how long it takes for a spring to technically finish, when the object is close enough to the target and moving slowly enough to be considered "at rest." Because springs use exponential decay, they technically keep moving forever with smaller and smaller movements. The settling duration can be unpredictable and varies based on many factors.

**Perceptual duration** is how long the animation *feels* like it takes. This is the duration parameter you actually set. Apple designed it to be predictable and stable, it doesn't shift around as you change other spring parameters. It's roughly how long until the animation is "mostly done," even if subtle settling continues after.

[Interactive example: Perceptual Duration](https://www.pulkit.blog/series/design-engineering/the-physics-behind-natural-motion)

This approach gives you the natural feel of spring physics while letting you think in familiar timing terms. A 300ms spring with no bounce behaves similarly to a 300ms ease-out, but handles interruptions better.

[Interactive example: Easing Curve](https://www.pulkit.blog/series/design-engineering/the-physics-behind-natural-motion)

Notice how at `bounce: 0`, the spring curve closely matches `ease-out`. As you increase bounce, the curve overshoots past 100% before settling. The key difference isn't visible in the graph: the spring can be interrupted mid-animation and will preserve its velocity, while `ease-out` would restart from zero.

Framer Motion supports both APIs. Use stiffness/damping/mass when you want fine control over the physics. Use duration/bounce when you want to match specific timing requirements.

### Spring Presets

Apple also introduced [spring presets in WWDC 2023](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10158/?time=1060), battle-tested values used throughout iOS. These are great starting points when you're not sure what parameters to use:

```swift
// SwiftUI spring presets
withAnimation(.snappy) { /* changes */ }
withAnimation(.bouncy) { /* changes */ }
withAnimation(.smooth) { /* changes */ }

// Customize with duration
withAnimation(.snappy(duration: 0.4)) { /* changes */ }

// Or add extra bounce
withAnimation(.snappy(extraBounce: 0.1)) { /* changes */ }
```

The presets aren't magic numbers. They're tunable starting points. You can take `.snappy` and make it faster with a custom duration, or give it more character with extra bounce. This approach, starting from a known-good preset and adjusting, is often easier than tuning stiffness and damping from scratch.

In web development, you can create similar presets:

```typescript
const SPRING_PRESETS = {
  snappy: { duration: 0.35, bounce: 0.1 },
  bouncy: { duration: 0.5, bounce: 0.3 },
  smooth: { duration: 0.5, bounce: 0 },
  gentle: { duration: 0.6, bounce: 0 },
};
```

## When Not to Use Springs

Springs aren't always the answer.

**Color and opacity changes.** These don't involve spatial movement. A spring-based opacity fade is overkill. CSS transitions work fine.

**Looping animations.** Loading spinners, progress indicators. These need predictable timing, not physics-based settling.

**Synchronized animations.** When multiple elements need to finish at exactly the same moment, springs make coordination harder.

**Performance-critical contexts.** Springs require JavaScript computation each frame. CSS animations run on the compositor thread. For smooth 60fps on low-end devices, CSS might be safer.

**Bundle size matters.** Framer Motion adds \~30KB to your bundle (minified + gzipped). React Spring is similar. If you're optimizing for initial load, consider whether springs are worth it for your use case.

```css
/* CSS is fine for these */
.button {
  transition: background-color 150ms ease-out;
}

.fade-in {
  animation: fadeIn 200ms ease-out;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

The trade-off is real. Vaul, the drawer component library, intentionally uses CSS animations despite wanting iOS-like spring physics. The author prioritized small bundle size over perfect native feel.

## Spring Animations in CSS?

CSS can't create true spring animations. There's no spring timing function. But you can approximate them.

The `linear()` function in modern CSS lets you define custom easing curves with many keyframes. You can pre-calculate a spring curve and encode it:

```css
.spring-approximation {
  transition: transform 500ms
    linear(
      0,
      0.009,
      0.035 2.1%,
      0.141,
      0.281 6.7%,
      0.723 12.9%,
      0.938 16.7%,
      1.017,
      1.077,
      1.121,
      1.149 24.3%,
      1.159,
      1.163,
      1.161,
      1.154 29.9%,
      1.129 32.8%,
      1.051 39.6%,
      1.017 43.1%,
      0.991,
      0.977 51%,
      0.974 53.8%,
      0.975 57.1%,
      0.997 69.8%,
      1.003 76.9%,
      1
    );
}
```

This creates bounce-like motion, but it's still duration-locked. You lose interruptibility. You lose the physics simulation. It's a visual approximation, not the real thing.

For simple cases where you want a bounce effect without adding a JS library, this works. But don't confuse it with actual spring animation.

## Building Your Spring Intuition

The best way to learn springs is to play with them. Change stiffness and watch how it affects snappiness. Change damping and watch how it affects settling. Change mass and watch how it affects inertia.

Some patterns to internalize:

**High stiffness + high damping** = Snappy and controlled. Good for UI elements that need to feel responsive without bounce.

**High stiffness + low damping** = Snappy and bouncy. Good for playful interactions.

**Low stiffness + high damping** = Slow and smooth. Good for gentle reveals.

**Low stiffness + low damping** = Slow and wobbly. Usually not what you want.

```typescript
// Stiffness affects how quickly it reaches the target
// Damping affects how much it oscillates around the target
// Mass affects how much inertia it has

const configs = {
  button: { stiffness: 500, damping: 30 },
  modal: { stiffness: 300, damping: 30 },
  drawer: { stiffness: 400, damping: 40 },
  tooltip: { stiffness: 600, damping: 35 },
  card: { stiffness: 300, damping: 25 },
};
```

## The iOS Feel

Apple uses springs everywhere. The home screen bounces when you scroll past the edge. The Dynamic Island morphs with spring physics. Sheets snap with spring animations.

This consistency creates a feeling that the entire OS is a physical space with physical rules. Things have weight. They respond to force. They settle naturally.

You can achieve this same feeling on the web. It requires:

1. **Consistent spring configs.** Don't use different physics for every element
2. **Appropriate bounce.** Match bounce to interaction type
3. **Smooth interruptions.** Let springs handle rapid interactions
4. **Subtle overshoot.** A tiny overshoot (even with zero bounce) adds life

The goal isn't to copy iOS. It's to understand why iOS feels the way it does, and apply those principles to your own design language.

## Conclusion

Spring animations aren't about adding bounce to your buttons. They're about creating motion that responds to the physics of interaction rather than arbitrary time constraints.

The key insight is interruptibility. When animations can be redirected mid-flight while preserving momentum, your entire interface feels more responsive. Users can act faster than animations complete, and the UI keeps up.

Start with CSS for simple color and opacity changes. Reach for springs when you have spatial motion that might be interrupted. And when you do use springs, keep bounce subtle unless the interaction genuinely calls for it.

The difference between good animation and great animation often comes down to these details. Not whether something moves, but whether it moves like it belongs in the physical world.
