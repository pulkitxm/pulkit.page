## Let's Start

To create your own `npx` command, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Project**:

   - Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project by running `pnpm init`. This will create a `package.json` file.
     ```json
     {
       "name": "bash-script",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "main": "cli.js",
       "scripts": {
         "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
       },
       "keywords": [],
       "author": "",
       "license": "ISC",
       "description": ""
     }
     ```

2. **Create the Script**:

   Inside your project directory, create a new file named `cli.js`. Inside the `cli.js` explain about yourself/ I chose the js object for this

   ```javascript
   const info = {
     name: "Pulkit",
     status: "CS student",
     web: "https://pulkitxm.com",
     linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/pulkitxm",
     gh: "https://github.com/Pulkitxm",
     twitter: "https://twitter.com/devpulkitt",
     desc: "Passionate about web & app development, MERN stack enthusiast, open-source contributor, and ICPC regionalist.",
     skills: {
       langs: ["JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Python"],
       skills: [
         "React",
         "React Native",
         "Node.js",
         "Express.js",
         "MongoDB",
         "Git",
         "Docker",
         "Networking",
       ],
     },
   };
   ```

   Now you can simply do a `console.log()`.

   ```javascript
   console.log(info);
   ```

   To get those colors, we can do this

   ```javascript
   const greenStr = (str) => `\x1b[32m${str}\x1b[32m`;
   ```

   This functions colorize strings in green using ANSI escape codes. The `\x1b[0m` at the end of each function resets the color back to default. Now to get the colorful text logged, we can do this

   ```javascript
   console.log(greenStr(JSON.stringify(info)));
   ```

   So, the final code looks like

   ```javascript
   console.clear();
   console.log("\n\x1b[36m", "Hi I am Pulkit 👋", "\x1b[0m\n");

   const greenStr = (str) => `\x1b[32m${str}\x1b[32m`;

   const info = {
     name: "Pulkit",
     status: "CS student",
     web: "https://pulkitxm.com",
     linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/pulkitxm",
     gh: "https://github.com/Pulkitxm",
     twitter: "https://twitter.com/devpulkitt",
     desc: "Passionate about web & app development, MERN stack enthusiast, open-source contributor, and ICPC regionalist.",
     skills: {
       langs: ["JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Python"],
       skills: [
         "React",
         "React Native",
         "Node.js",
         "Express.js",
         "MongoDB",
         "Git",
         "Docker",
         "Networking",
       ],
     },
   };

   console.log(greenStr(JSON.stringify(info, null, 2)));
   ```

3. **Update** `package.json`:

   - Open the `package.json` file and add a `bin` field to specify the command name and the script file. It should look something like this:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "devpulkit",
       "version": "0.1.1",
       "description": "just my intro",
       "main": "cli.js",
       "bin": "cli.js",
       "files": ["cli.js"]
     }
     ```

   Now you can publish the package to npm using `npm publish`. Once published, you can test your command by running `npx devpulkit` in your terminal.

By following these steps, you can create a personalized `npx` command to share your details effortlessly. I also added this on my portfolio.
