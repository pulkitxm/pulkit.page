# My First Talk: Claude Directory

> The story of the craziest 24 hours I've had: launching Claude Directory, watching it cross 75k views and 160+ stars overnight, and then walking up to demo it on stage for the very first time in my life.

Today was, without exaggeration, one of the craziest days I've had.

I launched a project, watched it do numbers I've never seen on anything I've made, and then, completely on impulse, got up in front of a room full of people and demoed it for the first time in my life. I work as a software engineer at [Noveum.ai](https://noveum.ai) and I've shipped plenty of things, but I had never once stood up and talked about my own work to a crowd. Today I did.

## Claude Directory

Last night I put a project live on my GitHub called [Claude Directory](https://github.com/pulkitxm/claude-directory): a directory of landing pages, hero sections, and interactive prototypes, more than 55 of them, every single one built end to end with [Fable 5](https://x.com/claudeai/status/2064394146916229443).

The loop was simple. I took prompts from public references, mostly [motionsites.ai](https://motionsites.ai/) and [this gist from cnemri](https://gist.github.com/cnemri/c917e11b3a6936823b509dcff53392aa), and handed them to Fable 5 to build the demos. Then I had Fable 5 write the recording script, captured a clean video of each one, and pulled it all into the [Claude Directory page](https://www.pulkit.page/claude-directory) on my portfolio. The page itself, the recording scripts, even the [launch video](https://youtu.be/mc3AYQplnM8): all Fable 5, start to finish. Each entry ships with the exact prompt I used, the open code in a single download click, and a demo video, so you can see what you're getting and just grab it.

I didn't do a big launch. I messaged people I know and told them to repost it only if they actually liked it. A lot of them did, and it snowballed: **75k+ views on X**, **160+ stars**, and **100 to 200 new follows** in twenty-four hours.

Then came the bittersweet twist: this morning the [US government blocked Fable 5 everywhere except the US](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2065597531644743999), so a chunk of the people who got excited couldn't even try the tool I'd built the whole thing with. The work is open though, and [at least we have the memories](https://x.com/_pulkitxm/status/2065646268672852448).

## My first talk

All of this was happening online while I was sitting at an event: **Localhost Build, at Microsoft**. At some point it hit me that if the project was getting this much attention on the internet right now, I should just show it to the people in the room. I asked a couple of friends, they said go for it, so I threw together a quick, slightly broken slide and presented.

[Watch on YouTube: Demoing Claude Directory at Localhost Build, Microsoft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYsE_CJn_rY)

I walked through what it was, how I built it, and the part I cared about most: the intuition behind building this way. It isn't magic, it's a way of working. At [Noveum.ai](https://noveum.ai) we lean on AI heavily, for planning, for structured workflows, and a huge amount of my day runs through [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com). To give you a sense of it, here's my usage over the last few weeks:

![My Claude Code activity calendar from May 26 to June 13: 5.76 billion tokens across 19 active days out of 19, with opus-4-8 as the top model and almost all usage coming from Code.](https://pulkit.page/assets/content/public/blogs/my-first-talk/claude-code-usage.webp)

*~5.76B tokens in about three weeks. opus-4-8 doing most of the heavy lifting, and almost all of it from coding work, automations, etc...*

Roughly 5.76 billion tokens in three weeks, nineteen active days out of nineteen. That is the honest answer to how I shipped 55+ demos, recorded them, and built a directory page in a couple of days.

And then the part I will remember longest: people liked it. They asked questions, I answered, and there was this back-and-forth I genuinely did not expect. A few of them said they were proud of me. I was nervous out of my mind, it was my first time speaking and my first time demoing anything live, but I got through it, and I think I would do it again.

And the kindness was not only in the room. The replies on X kept coming, and a few of them really stuck with me:

The best part was not the views or the stars. It was the people I got to meet. What a day.
